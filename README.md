I FINISHED IT!

Yes, I finished this project just for [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com), that was deadass my only motivation.
# TylkoLinux
TylkoLinux, an LFS system

## Installation
Working on the guide, at [RSCC](https://rootsource.cc/Articles/tylkolinux-installation/)

## To do

- [ ] ~~Make a package manager~~ ~~*Nix will be used*~~ Nah fuck that we need an actual package manager

- [X] Try to make system bootable

- [X] Finish the project in the first place

Maybe maybe maybe:

- [ ] Invent an easier way to distribute the distro

## Contributing
I don't know what else to type lol just open a PR when this project is done
#### What would also help is to report any security vulnerability and/or bugs found on https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/errata/12.2-systemd/ in the Issues tab
